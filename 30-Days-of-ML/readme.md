# 30-Days-of-ML

This repository contains resources, projects and anything else people have created during the 30 Days of Machine Learning Challenge.

## About the challenge

The 30 Days of ML Challenge is a challenge where you can learn anything you want that will connect with machine learning, help resolve each other's doubt, learn with the community and share your daily learnings with each other.

In this challenge, people will post daily updates about whatever they've learned, be it any videos lectures, blog, project or anything else. 

Here is a sample of what the message may look like in our Discord server - 

Day 1, 
Started with Introduction to ML course by Andrew Ng, learned about linear regression in lecture 1

This is just a template and there won't be any limitation of format or anything. This is how we can daily share our learnings so that we can stay motivated as well as we can post our doubts and work on them together.
